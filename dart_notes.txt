#DartNotes

"Everything is an object, in Dart."

1. All the data types are objects. So whatever we see in dart are objects. So default values will be null unless we initialize    them.
2. We can declare variables as in c++. Also, dart offers 'var' keyword, which lets the compiler automatically detect the          dataType of the value. If value is integer, age will be inferred as integer.
3. Some examples : int, double, bool, String, var, etc.
4. Literals
  a. Defining something straightaway. example:
      2;
      "Jon"
      1.6;
      etc.
  b. In dart, concatenating two strings does not need +. Example:
      String a = "I am here"
                 "So are you.";
      //It will automatically get combined.



5. Functions or methods in dart.
  a. Functions in dart are objects.
  b. So, a function can be assigned to a variable, so a variable in dart can store a function as well.
  c. Function can be passed as parameter to some other function.
  d. All function in dart return some value. if no return value, then function returns 'null'.
  e. main() is also a function and is the entry point of the application. it wil be the first function that will be executed        always.
